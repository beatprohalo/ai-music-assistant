# 🔧 Dependency Issue Fixed!

## ❌ **Problem**
The packaged app was missing the `@tonejs/midi` dependency, causing this error:
```
Error: Cannot find module '@tonejs/midi'
```

## ✅ **Solution**
Updated the build configuration in `package.json` to include all dependencies:

### Before (Problematic):
```json
"files": [
  "**/*",
  "!node_modules/**/*",  // ❌ This excluded all dependencies
  "!src/**/*",
  // ... other exclusions
]
```

### After (Fixed):
```json
"files": [
  "**/*",
  // ✅ Removed "!node_modules/**/*" to include dependencies
  "!src/**/*",
  // ... other exclusions
]
```

## 🔄 **What Was Done**
1. **Removed the exclusion** of `node_modules` from the build files
2. **Cleaned previous builds** to remove old artifacts
3. **Rebuilt the app** with all dependencies included
4. **Verified the fix** by checking the app.asar size (now 18MB vs smaller before)
